## Weave Voice Memos

This is a permaweb that allows users to create and securely save voice memo's on the go in the arweave blockchain.

After the memo's are saved in arweave, they are displayed back in the app for the user to replay and also download to their respective device.

## Install and Run

1. Open the project in the CLI and install the necessary node-dependencies i.e. `npm i`
2. Run the command `npm start` to start and run the project

## Future Updates

After the release of this MVP, i'm now working on adding the following features to make the app even more delightful to use

1. Ability to share memo's to social media.
2. Ability to also add video memo's too, once the file upload limit has been removed from arweave.
